/// Enforces the project's cross-feature dependency rule from
/// `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` §5 / `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` §2 at CI time:
///
///   **A feature must not import another feature's `application` or `data`.**
///   Only that feature's `domain` (pure Dart contracts) and `presentation`
///   (shared widgets such as `ModelSettingsAppBar` / `AppMarkdown`, which the UI
///   conventions deliberately reuse) may be imported across features. All
///   cross-feature *composition* (wiring one feature's controllers/services into
///   another) goes through `app/di` instead — `app/` is the composition root and
///   is exempt.
///
/// This is the substitute for a `custom_lint` boundary plugin: the latest
/// `custom_lint` only supports analyzer ^8, incompatible with the analyzer ^10+
/// required by this SDK's codegen toolchain. Scanning imports in a test gives the
/// same "fail the build on violation" guarantee without the version conflict.
/// Migrate to a `custom_lint` plugin once it supports analyzer ^10+.
///
/// [_knownAcceptedViolations] is a frozen baseline of cross-feature
/// application/data imports that predate this guard. **Do not add entries** —
/// new cross-feature composition must go through `app/di`. The list only exists
/// so the guard can be green today while the existing debt is migrated.
